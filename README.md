# ðŸ˜· Face Mask Detection (YOLOv5)  

This project implements **YOLOv5** to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Uses **YOLOv5** for face mask detection  
- Can be deployed on **CCTV cameras, mobile apps, and web applications**  
- Detects **"Mask"** and **"No Mask"**

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled images with bounding boxes for face mask detection. It can be obtained from:  
ðŸ”— [Kaggle: Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection)
