# ðŸ˜· Face Mask Detection (YOLOv5)  

This project implements **YOLOv5** to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Uses **YOLOv5** for high-speed, real-time face mask detection  
- Can be deployed on **CCTV cameras, mobile apps, and web applications**  
- Detects **"Mask"**, **"No Mask"**, and optionally **"Improper Mask"**  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled images with bounding boxes for face mask detection. It can be obtained from:  
ðŸ”— [Kaggle: Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection)  

## ðŸ›  Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/somtoval/Face-Mask-Detector.git
